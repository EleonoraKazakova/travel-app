# Front End Nanodegree Program

## FEND Capstone Project: Travel App

### Description
In this project I use:
- [Geonames](http://www.geonames.org/) geographical database 
- [Weatherbit](https://www.weatherbit.io/) is a site where you can retrieve current weather
- [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) is a site with free photos 
- [REST Countries](https://restcountries.eu/) ia a site where you can get information about countries.

The user enters the following:
- City
- Start of the trip
- The end of the trip

The user will receive:
- Country
- City
- Travel date
- Length of trip
- Full name of the country
- Currency
- Population
- Longitude
- Latitude
- Weather forecast for the next 16 days

Also the user can remove a trip. And when the trip ended, the background color turned gray.
